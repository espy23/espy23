### Get to know me:
**Cyber things**
- I got my MS in Cybersecurity from NYU through their amazing Cyber Fellows scholarship program!
- In my final class at NYU, playing in a CTF was a requirement to pass. I had so much fun doing it. I'm still new to it, but I play whenever I have free time.


**Other things I love**
- Travel - Scotland and New Zealand are at the top of my list.
- Animals - Especially dogs, elephants and owls (unfortunately, I rarely get to see the last 2).
- Board games - Some of my favorites are Catan, Wits and Wagers, Scrabble, and Racko (a super fun card game my family discovered over the holidays).
- Reading - Fantasy is my go-to genre but I just love a good story.
- Movies - Give me all the Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Rom-Coms, Action, and Superhero movies!
